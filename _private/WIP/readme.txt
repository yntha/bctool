this was originally going to be part of the tool, but it's taking up too
much of my time now. the code here is for a full fledged smali parser i
have been working on specifically for this project. my goal when creating
this parser was so that i can (properly) rename a type(i.e class name,
class package, etc) to something else. so, given the basic goal i had in
mind, i feel like continuing this part of the tool is just overkill. i'm
impressed with what i have so far and i will continue to work on this
parser over time since there really isnt anything like it right now. for
now though, i have to get back on track with the tool, lol.
